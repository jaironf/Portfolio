# My Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio built using React. It's a Single Page Application (SPA) that allows users to navigate between different sections of the site without reloading the page. In this portfolio, I showcase who I am, my skills, my projects, and how to get in touch with me in a professional and clear way.

## Features

- **Home Page**: A welcome and introduction to the portfolio.
- **About Me Page**: Information about my career, education, and skills.
- **Projects Page**: A list of my personal and professional projects with descriptions.
- **Contact Page**: How to contact me, including my email, GitHub, and LinkedIn.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The main library I used to build the user interface.
- **React Router**: To handle navigation between the different sections of the SPA.
- **Chakra UI**: I used this framework to create accessible, responsive, and customizable components.
- **SCSS**: For managing styles in a more efficient and modular way.
